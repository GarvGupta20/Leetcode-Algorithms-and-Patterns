This alorithm is a simple algorithm which has to keep track of a next greater element or next shorter element or whatsover but when look at the brute force approach it took at least 0(n^2) time to be able to move with it 
hence we require to look over  only those candidates that are important hence we use a stack because it let us insertion and removal at the expense of constant time and then on the basis of whais required for the 
algorithm we add it to our stack and voila we have just reduced the time complexity of this algorithm to its bare minimum hnce proved to be very helfl and used in many Interview level Questions
