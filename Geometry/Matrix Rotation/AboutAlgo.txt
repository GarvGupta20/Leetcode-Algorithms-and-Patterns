                                                                                                                                             Matrix Rotation :

simple trick : First of all check the direction of the matrix as clockwise or anticlockwise then try to check the degrees of rotation as it will matter
Now when you have both of them you can see how matrix works 

eg -  1 2 3
       4 5  6
       7 8 9 

now we can observe if we have to rotate the matrix 90 deg in clockwise 

1 ----> will come in place of 3
3 ---> 9
9 ----> 7
7 -----> 1

now will move to 2 4  6 8

then both of them done we can observe that we are done with roattaion

so how will we traverse the matrix 

we are dealing with the matrix as it is an onion that is we go inside the layers as frame

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
1 2222222     1 
1 2222222     1 
1 2222222     1
1 2222222    1       
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1


now if we really observe this matrix we can see that we are coming down and up at same time so it will traverse 
n/2 times only 

for the inner loop we have to start with i as from which layer we are starting on then we move 
to the swapping parts
